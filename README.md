## commatrix

This project allows to automatically generate an accurate and up-to-date communication  
flows matrix that can be delivered to customers as part of product documentation for all  
ingress flows of OpenShift (multi-node and single-node deployments).

### Usage of the EndpointSlice Resource

This library leverages the EndpointSlice resource to identify the ports the  
cluster uses for ingress traffic. Relevant EndpointSlices include those  
referencing host-networked pods, Node Port services, and LoadBalancer services.

### Creating Custom ComDetails with ss Command

The `ss` command, a Linux utility, lists open ports on  
the host with `ss -anplt` for TCP or `ss -anplu` for UDP.
For example, consider the following ss entry:
```
LISTEN 0      4096    127.0.0.1:10248 0.0.0.0:* users:(("kubelet",pid=6187,fd=20))
```

The `ss` package provides the `CreateSSOutputFromNode` function that runs
the `ss` command on each node, and converts the output into a corresponding ComDetails list.  

### Communication Matrix Creation Guide

Use the `generate` Makefile target to create the matrix.
Add additional entires to the matrix via a custom file, using
the variables `CUSTOM_ENTRIES_PATH` and `CUSTOM_ENTRIES_FORMAT`.
Examples are available in the `example-custom-entries` files.

The following environment variables are used to configure:
```
FORMAT (csv/json/yaml/nft)
DEST_DIR (path to the directory containing the artifacts)
CUSTOM_ENTRIES_PATH (path to the file containing custom entries to add to the matrix)
CUSTOM_ENTRIES_FORMAT (the format of the custom entries file (json,yaml,csv))
```

The generated artifcats are:
```
communication-matrix - The generated communication matrix.
ss-generated-matrix - The communication matrix that generated by the `ss` command.
matrix-diff-ss - Shows the variance between two matrices. Entries present in the communication matrix but absent in the ss matrix are marked with '+', while entries present in the ss matrix but not in the communication matrix are marked with '-'.
raw-ss-tcp - The raw `ss` output for TCP.
raw-ss-udp - The raw `ss` output for UDP.
```

Each record describes a flow with the following information:
```
direction      Data flow direction (currently ingress only)
protocol       IP protocol (TCP/UDP/SCTP/etc)
port           Flow port number
namespace      EndpointSlice Namespace
service        EndpointSlice owner Service name
pod            EndpointSlice target Pod name
container      Port owner Container name
nodePool       Resolved MachineConfigPool name (e.g., master, worker, or custom pool)
optional       Optional or mandatory flow for OpenShift
```

### MachineConfigPool selection

When associating a node to a MachineConfigPool (MCP), the pool is derived directly from the node annotation `machineconfiguration.openshift.io/currentConfig`, expected in the form `rendered-<pool>-<hash>`. The pool name is obtained by removing the `rendered-` prefix and trimming the trailing `-<hash>`.

The resolved pool name is recorded in the `nodePool` field of each matrix entry, and NFT output is generated per pool.
